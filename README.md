# Stock Price Prediction By Geometric Brownian Motion in Frontier Markets

## Overview

This project explores the use of Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to predict stock prices in frontier markets, specifically focusing on the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange (HOSE). The project also compares the performance of GBM with ARIMA models, using MAPE as criteria. Result of the project will be used for my Master Thesis.
